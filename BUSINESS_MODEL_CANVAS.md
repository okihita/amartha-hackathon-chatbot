## Executive Summary

Akademi-AI is an AI-powered WhatsApp chatbot that revolutionizes financial literacy education and credit assessment for Indonesia's 64 million UMKM (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises). By combining Google Gemini AI with automated image analysis, we transform how microfinance institutions assess creditworthiness and deliver financial education at scale.

**The Problem:** Traditional microfinance requires manual verification, in-person meetings, and paper-based assessments. This limits reach, increases costs, and creates barriers for rural entrepreneurs.

**Our Solution:** An intelligent WhatsApp assistant that provides 24/7 financial literacy support, automates credit scoring through business photo analysis, and delivers personalized education based on business maturity levels.
